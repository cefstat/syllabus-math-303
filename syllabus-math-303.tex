\textbf{Office:} IB 1020 \\
\textbf{Office hours:} Monday and Wednesday 10:00 – 11:00 or on Zoom by appointment \\

\textbf{Short bio:} Dr. Efstathiou fell in love with dynamical systems after reading, as an undergraduate student, Gleick's \emph{Chaos} and Arnold's \emph{Ordinary Differential Equations}. He studied physics all the way up to his PhD, focusing on the more mathematical aspects of physics, especially those related to dynamics and geometry. After his PhD, he has worked in the Mathematics departments of the University of Groningen and the Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University. His research concerns the geometric aspects of Hamiltonian dynamical systems and the behavior of dynamical systems on networks.

\section{What is this course about?}

Differential equations and dynamical systems are essential mathematical tools for modeling a large variety of phenomena. They are used in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Ecology, Finance, Sociology, and beyond, to describe various processes. However, differential equations in most cases cannot be solved and we need to use qualitative methods in order to understand such processes. 

In this course we will do two things. First, we will see how to solve some \textbf{first-order} differential equations and \textbf{linear} differential equations. The fact that such differential equations can be solved makes them very special. Second, we will consider \textbf{nonlinear} differential equations. In general, these cannot be solved, and therefore we will need to qualitatively understand the behavior of the solutions, without actually finding them. To achieve this, we will combine our knowledge of the solutions of linear differential equations with other theoretical results from the theory of dynamical systems. 

This course uses results from single- and multi-variable Calculus and from Linear Algebra and it is a prime example of how such results can be applied in more complicated contexts with a wide range of applications in other scientific domains. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{What background knowledge do I need before taking this course?}

There are two prerequisite courses:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item MATH 201 Multivariable Calculus.
\item MATH 202 Linear Algebra.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, it will be useful (but not strictly required) to have some prior familiarity with:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item LaTeX.
\item Structured programming (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.) in any programming language.
\item Mathematica.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{What will I learn in this course?}

After successfully completing the course students will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\arabic*.},noitemsep]
\item define the basic theoretical concepts of differential equations and dynamical systems;
\item distinguish between different types of dynamical systems and dynamical behavior;
\item prove the basic theoretical results on differential equations and dynamical systems;
\item describe the dynamics of a system given its phase portrait;
\item solve first order differential equations and linear systems of differential equations;
\item calculate the linearization at an equilibrium;
\item determine the dynamics and transient vs asymptotic behavior of specific systems;
\item classify linear and nonlinear dynamics in terms of stability and asymptotic behavior;
\item determine the best approach for understanding the dynamics of specific systems (e.g., solving the equations vs using qualitative approaches);
\item formulate a study-plan and research questions for studying the dynamics of specific systems.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{What will I do in this course?}

The course consists of lectures, computer labs, and an applied project. 

During the lectures the instructor will review the main relevant ideas and, in some cases, delve into more technical aspects of the topic. You are expected to have studied the material for each lecture as contained in this syllabus and as it will be communicated to you through Sakai. The purpose of the lectures is to help you get oriented in the vast field of dynamical systems by presenting the main ideas, how they are related to each other, and in which directions they can be extended. You are strongly encouraged to ask questions and discuss unclear points during lectures. During lectures there will also be activities such as “clicker” questions and problem-solving.

In the computer labs (which will be integrated with the lectures) you will use Mathematica to simulate the dynamics of several dynamical systems and to visualize the results. The purpose of the labs is to make more concrete the, often abstract, theoretical concepts that we will discuss in the lectures and to introduce an element of play, that is essential for getting an intuitive feeling of different dynamical behaviors. An introduction to Mathematica will be given. 

The assessment of the learning objectives will be performed through a combination of homework assignments, exams (midterm and final), and an applied project. Computer labs will not be graded separately.

There will be 6 homework assignments. The purpose of the homework assignments is to make you actively think about the covered material and to assess your progress, providing also signs on how well the learning objectives are attained throughout the teaching session. You will receive feedback on your homework assignments and the answers will be made available through Sakai. The style of the problems in the homework assignments will be similar to the style of the problems in the midterm and final exams.

The midterm exam will assess learning objectives related to linear systems, while the final exam will assess learning objectives for the whole course, but the emphasis will be on nonlinear systems.

In the applied project you will work in groups to understand a specific dynamical system by setting up a plan on how to study its dynamics, performing the analysis of the dynamics, and presenting your results through an oral presentation and a written report. The purpose of the applied project is to let you decide for a given dynamical system which of the results and techniques can be applied to study its dynamics and thus let you progress from passively understanding the material to actively using it. 

For the applied project you will work in groups of 3-4 students. Each project will be assessed through an oral presentation (20 minutes) and a written report (about 10 pages in length). The presentation and the report must be able to demonstrate that you understand what are the relevant concepts to apply in the study of your system.  In the first week we will discuss some possible topics for the projects. You will be able to either select your topic from a list that will be put on Sakai before the beginning of the course or come up with your own topic in consultation with the instructor. By the end of the second week you will need to form groups and submit a project proposal. In the following weeks you will work on different parts of the project report and presentation by submitting the literature review (week 3), describing the main questions you plan to consider and your motivation (week 4), writing and running code and studying the relevant theory (weeks 5, 6) and preparing the final report (overall structure, introduction, and conclusions, in week 7). There will be two presentations. The first one, covering literature review and main questions / motivation will take place in week 4 and will be strictly for receiving feedback from me and your fellow students. The final presentation in week 7 will be graded. The rubrics for the presentation and the written report and more specific guidance on completing these will be made available.

Finally, you should make ample use of office hours and other opportunities to interact and ask questions (e.g., Sakai forums). If the given office hours do not work for you, send me an e-mail to arrange an appointment. My role is to guide and support your learning — do not hesitate to come to me with your questions and comments.

\section{How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?}

To prepare for the course:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item Review the material from MATH 202 Linear Algebra concerning eigenvalues, eigenvectors, similarity transformations, and diagonalization of matrices.
\item Install Mathematica on your laptop and get an Overleaf account.
\end{itemize}

To prepare for class meetings:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item Make sure that you have a thorough understanding of the material covered in previous sessions and prepare a list of questions concerning aspects of the material that is still unclear. You can ask these questions during the following session or during office hours.
\item Read carefully through the corresponding upcoming sections in the textbook (the lecture schedule is given later in this syllabus) and prepare questions to ask during the lectures. I will briefly review this material in every lecture but will not go through every point in detail.  
\item Study auxiliary resources (for example, videos) that will be communicated to you through Sakai before the lectures.
\item Bring your laptop to class.
\item At the beginning of every part of the course (see the schedule later in the syllabus) I will hand out a reading guide about the material that you should focus on. I expect that you come to the class meetings having gone through the reading guide, having read the corresponding sections from the textbook, and having watched any required videos.
\end{itemize}

To prepare for the applied project:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item Make sure that you know how to produce a written report and a presentation with many equations and mathematical symbols by using LaTeX.
\item If you have taken WOC 203 and WOC 204 review what you have learned there about scientific writing and giving effective presentations.
\end{itemize}

To prepare for the midterm and final exams:
\begin{itemize}[label={-},noitemsep]
\item Review the solved problems from homework assignments and the problems solved in class. Make sure that you have mastered the problems. You can check this by being able to solve the problems without checking at all the given solutions.
\end{itemize}
